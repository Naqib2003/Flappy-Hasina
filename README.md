# 🐦 Flappy Hasina – The Ultimate Political Parody Game!

**DISCLAIMER: This game is made purely for comedy and satire. If you take it seriously, that's on you.**

Welcome to the most **banned-worthy**, **diplomatically dangerous**, and **unexpectedly addictive** Scratch game ever created – **Flappy Hasina**!

Inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, but with a spicy political twist that might get your internet monitored (hi, DGFI 👋).

## 🎮 How to Play
- Just like Flappy Bird.
- But instead of a chubby bird, you're flapping around as the *glorious* former Prime Minister of Bangladesh.
- Dodge the pillars of corruption, censorship, and democracy (wait, do we even have that?).
- Crash into one, and it's over. Much like freedom of speech.

## 🛠 Built With
- [Scratch 3](https://scratch.mit.edu) – Because who needs Unity when you're trying to cause an international incident with drag-and-drop blocks?

## 🚨 Warning
Playing this game may result in:
- Government surveillance
- Political awakening
- Sudden disappearance
- Or worse: getting added to a “watch list”

## 💥 Features
- Rage-inducing gameplay
- Highly questionable character design
- More satire than your average Bangladeshi news outlet
- Sounds that will haunt your dreams

## 📢 Final Words
If you're a government agent reading this, hi. It's a joke. Chill.
If you're a random guy looking for entertainment — welcome to the circus 🎪.

*Freedom of speech is a myth... but funny Scratch games are real.*
